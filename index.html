		<h1 style="color:black;">Living in Abu Dhabi, the Experience of a Lifetime</h1>
		<p style="color:red;">When I was in seventh grade, my mom, stepfather, two sisters and I moved to Abu Dhabi, the capital city of the United Arab Emirates. I lived there for seventh, eighth, and eleventh grade and my family still lives there. I visit them at least once a year and am flying to the UAE on December 14 this year to go spend Christmas with them. Living in Abu Dhabi changed my perspective on the world and shaped me into the person I am today, and I could not be more grateful that my parents gave me the opportunity to call it home for a few years.</p>
		<p style="color:green;">Initially, adjusting to all of the differences moving halfway across the world entailed was very difficult for me. I would ask my dad to let me come back to the US and was very reluctant to accept the fact that I was going to be there for two years. Gradually, my culture shock wore off and I ended up loving my new home. I enjoyed living there so much that I begged to stay for high school, not knowing I would get the chance to move back in eleventh grade.</p>
		<p>The school I attended in Abu Dhabi was an international school with an American curriculum, and students of seventy six different nationalities were enrolled there. My sisters and I all went to the same school, and they still go there. My mom works there in the library as well. I took Arabic and French during the three years I went to school there, and learned a lot about myself and the world on top of my studies. Being immersed in such a rich multicultural environment changed my entire outlook on the world and changed me as a person forever. I will always carry the impact Abu Dhabi has made on myself and could not imagine how different my life would be if I wasn't given the opportunity to live there.</p>
